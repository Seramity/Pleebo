                    Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on {{ app.name }}'s website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

                        <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
                        <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by {{ app.name }} at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>3. Termination</h2>

            <p>We may terminate your access to the Site, without cause or notice, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with you. All provisions of this Agreement that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

            <h2>4. Disclaimer</h2>

            <ol type="a">
                <li>The materials on {{ app.name }}'s website are provided on an 'as is' basis. {{ app.name }} makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.</li>

Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>
